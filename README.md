Sneaker
=======

You can use this to hot-update some files in java applications.
Now it only care about the http method so you can use get or post method to sneak
update some files without restart.
Consider that some java applications are not web application. The Sneaker provides
a simple httpserver which could process get and post easilly.


Dependencies
------------

groovy-all-minimal.jar


Information
-----------
I also use the Sneaker to write a hot-update example, all the source code is in example directory.
